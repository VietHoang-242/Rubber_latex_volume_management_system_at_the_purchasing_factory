# Motorcycle Anti-Theft and GPS Tracking System 

## Introduction

This is a project about the ESP32 microcontroller, control and location monitoring system for motorcycles.
- Remote locking/unlocking system using ESP-NOW protocol between two ESP32 modules.
- Real-time theft detection via vibration sensor (SW420) and buzzer alarm.
- Location tracking using Quectel EG800K GPS module and 4G network communication. GPS data upload to Firebase Realtime Database via HTTP and SMS.
- ReactJS-based web interface for viewing real-time location and tracking history on maps.
Knowledge used in the project:
- Use UART protocol to communicate with Quectel EG800K by AT command.
- Use ESP-NOW protocol.
- Database use is Google Firebase.
- Frontend use is ReactJS framework.

## Result
- 3D shape of the positioning and anti-theft PCB layer.
